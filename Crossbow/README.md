a solution to a puzzle named "Chinese Repeating Crossbow"

In Chinese history, Zhuge Liang, prime minister of Shu in three kingdoms period, isregarded as the embodiment of wisdom. When he was dying he passed a book to his apprentice Jiang Wei privately. This book recorded the introduction andspecification of a most powerful weapon at that time, called Chinese repeating crossbow or Zhuge repeating crossbow . This weapon can shoot many arrows in a very short time and makes enemies very hard to defense it.

Later on, JiangWei built a repeating crossbow according to the book and he wanted to know exactly about its power. He came to the center of a test field. The test field was ragged with several extreme high straw walls. Jiang Wei wanted to choose adirection, shot through as many straw walls as he can by his new weapon.

The problem given toyou is quite simple: assuming that the repeating crossbow can shot through anynumbers of straw walls, please help Jiang Wei to choose a certain direction that he can shot through maximum number of walls in one shot. The walls can be considered as line segments, and if an arrow touches the end points of a wall, it'salso called "shoot through". The straw walls can intersect or overlap with each other, and Jiang Wei may possibly stand extremely close to one of the straw wall.
